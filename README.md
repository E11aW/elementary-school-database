# NE Elementary School Database Project
A small database project centered around improving data management of a small-scale elementary school.

This project was completed over the span of about a month in a small group with 3 other contributors. We all worked together to plan out the business prolem we would solve, design our database, and implement specific API to allow users to interact with our database system. Our official business problem was as follows:
 
>  "We are a small, local elementary school that is struggling to keep accurate records of students, guardian contact information, classes, and staff. We have always used binders filled with paper entries, and it is not efficient enough to keep up with the growing neighborhoods in our community. We need to automate our ability to keep records to ensure accuracy and efficiency."

The database and APIs my group implemented solved this school's problem by allowing for easier data storage and manipulation, thus enabling the school to more easily keep track of their records of students, staff, and classes. This whole project was completed using PostgreSQL for the database and Python for implementing all the APIs and managing the database connection.
